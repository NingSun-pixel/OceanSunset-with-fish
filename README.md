# 🌅 Ocean Sunset with Fish  

A graphics demo project showcasing an **ocean sunset scene** with **animated fish swimming** in a physically based rendering (PBR) pipeline built using **OpenGL**.  
The project demonstrates real-time rendering, environment lighting, and GPU instancing to simulate an immersive underwater and sunset atmosphere.

## 🎮 Overview  

**OceanSunset-with-fish** is a study/demo project focusing on:  

- **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)** recreated in OpenGL  
- **Animated fish** swimming across the scene  
- **Dynamic environment** with sunset lighting and water reflections  
- **GPU instancing** for efficient rendering of multiple fish  

> “A calm ocean at sunset, with fish moving gracefully — a demo of light, water, and life in real-time graphics.”

## 🎨 Additional Work  

### Blender Modeling & Python Export  
I modeled the fish and environment assets in **Blender**, and also wrote a **Python script** to automate the export of the scene.

### 🐟 GPU Instancing for Fish  
To efficiently render multiple fish, I used **GPU instancing**, which allows hundreds of fish to swim in the scene without a heavy performance cost.

### 💡 Two Lighting Setups  
I experimented with **two different lighting settings** to achieve distinct moods for the ocean sunset scene.
