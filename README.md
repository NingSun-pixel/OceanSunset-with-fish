# üåÖ Ocean Sunset with Fish  

A graphics demo project showcasing an **ocean sunset scene** with **animated fish swimming** in a physically based rendering (PBR) pipeline built using **OpenGL**.  
The project demonstrates real-time rendering, environment lighting, and GPU instancing to simulate an immersive underwater and sunset atmosphere.

## üéÆ Overview  

**OceanSunset-with-fish** is a study/demo project focusing on:  

- **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)** recreated in OpenGL  
- **Animated fish** swimming across the scene  
- **Dynamic environment** with sunset lighting and water reflections  
- **GPU instancing** for efficient rendering of multiple fish

 This is what I have done in blender,modeling and write a python to control the export of the scene.
